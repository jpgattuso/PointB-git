- Please put here all modifications/addings that you make to Data_DIC file.
- Every tuesdays (or during the same week), EOL/ptB spectro pH at lab temperature must be entered in this database by Hortense and Samir, after analysis. 
- A pH flag must be also entered for all replicates (2 = OK, 3 = outlier). This flag is determined using pHinsi() function in R at constant temperature. When pH are converted with constant temperature, a difference with the replicate and the mean greater than 0.01 unit pH leads to a flag 3 (outlier).
- Hortense should add nutrients/ALK/DIC/Chla time to time when results are available (every 5/6 months).
- remove the old update of each parameter.
